## Why Timing Matters in Forex Trading

‚è±Ô∏è The Forex market is active 24 hours a day from Monday to Friday. However, **not all hours are equally profitable**. Market volatility, liquidity, and volume vary depending on the time of day and session overlap.

Trading during high-liquidity hours allows for tighter spreads, faster execution, and more predictable movements‚Äîcrucial for both scalping and trend-based strategies.
