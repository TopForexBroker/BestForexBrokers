## What Does No Commission Mean in Forex?

In Forex trading, brokers earn revenue either through **commissions per trade** or **spreads** (the difference between the bid and ask prices). A **no commission broker** does not charge a per-trade fee but instead earns through slightly wider spreads.

Traders often prefer commission-free trading because:

- It simplifies the cost structure
- There are no surprise charges per transaction
- It is easier to plan and test strategies

However, it's essential to compare brokersâ€™ spreads as wide spreads can eat into potential profitsâ€”especially for scalpers or intraday traders.
