## Understanding How Forex Works

Forex (foreign exchange) involves buying one currency and selling another. When the value of the currency pair moves in your favor, you earn money based on the number of lots you traded and the pips gained.

**Example:** If you buy EUR/USD at 1.1000 and it rises to 1.1050, you've gained 50 pips. On a standard lot (100,000 units), thatâ€™s roughly \$500 profit.

âœ… **Compounding**: Small consistent profits can be compounded into larger gains over time.

âœ… **Hedging & Diversification**: Some advanced traders hedge positions or diversify across pairs.
