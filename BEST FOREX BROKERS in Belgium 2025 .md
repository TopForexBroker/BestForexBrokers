## Why Broker Selection Matters

Selecting the right broker affects your **trading costs**, **order execution**, and **capital protection**. A well‚Äëregulated, transparent broker ensures fair pricing, fast withdrawals, and robust customer support‚Äîessential for traders of all experience levels.  

---

## Key Evaluation Criteria

### Regulation & Safety  
Belgian traders should prioritize brokers regulated by top-tier authorities (FCA, CySEC, ASIC) to ensure client fund segregation and negative‚Äëbalance protection.  

### Spreads & Commissions  
Lower spreads reduce trading costs. Compare raw‚Äëspread (ECN) vs. fixed‚Äëspread accounts based on your strategy (scalping vs. swing trading).  

### Platforms & Tools  
MetaTrader 4/5, cTrader, and proprietary platforms each offer unique charting, EA support, and mobile capabilities.  

### Leverage & Margin  
While high leverage can amplify gains, it increases risk. Choose a broker offering flexible leverage up to 1:500 with proper margin call levels.  

### Deposits & Withdrawals  
Fast, low‚Äëcost funding via bank transfer, credit card, and e‚Äëwallets (Skrill, Neteller) is critical.  

### Education & Research  
Quality webinars, tutorials, and daily market analysis empower both new and experienced traders.
